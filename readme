This software requires configuration before running, please run lsblk and enter just the partition into the partition variable in config.env
The partition required should be like /dev/"sdb"

When running the Mount_input_images script, comment out or remove the old cifs mount point in /etc/fstab and then reboot, otherwise it cant mount the directory.
